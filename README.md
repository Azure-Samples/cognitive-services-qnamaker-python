## Features

Included are the following samples:

* [Create knowledge base](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-qnamaker-python/blob/master/create-new-knowledge-base.py). Create a brand new knowledge base with given FAQ URLs. You may supply your own.
* [Update knowledge base](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-qnamaker-python/blob/master/update-knowledge-base.py). Update an existing knowledge base by changing its name.
* [Publish knowledge base](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-qnamaker-python/blob/master/publish-knowledge-base.py). Publish any existing knowledge base to the host your Azure account.
* [Replace knowledge base](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-qnamaker-python/blob/master/replace-knowledge-base.py). Replace an entire existing knowledge base with a custom question/answer pair.
* [Download knowledge base](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-qnamaker-python/blob/master/download-knowledge-base.py). Download the contents of your existing knowledge base in JSON.

All REST samples revolve around what you can do with a knowledge base, which is made up of FAQs or product manuals where there is a question and an answer. QnA Maker gives you more control over how to answer questions by allowing you to train a chat bot to give answers in a variety of ways that feels more like natural, conversational exchanges.
